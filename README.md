# robot-soccer-ai
A class project for CS

## Setup
In order to get this to work, you need to make sure the files are wherever you ran the java command. Look for the
savedDSP2.zip and the Qit file for those. They should be located in src/sebbot/ballcapture. Put those to wherever you
plan to run the command.
